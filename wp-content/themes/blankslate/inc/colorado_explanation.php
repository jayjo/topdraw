<p class="intro">Colorado is a state that most hunters should be building points in.  Averaging around 135 total P&Y entries annually, it trails only WY in recent entries. Coloradoâ€™s game management program is focused mostly on hunter opportunity and leads the way in elk, bighorn sheep & mountain goat entries year in and year out.  Despite catering heavily towards hunting opportunity, it turns out bigger archery mule deer and moose than any other state.</p>
