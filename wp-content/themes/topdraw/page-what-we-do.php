				<p>Tired of seeing giants killed every year across the west only to find out it was a guided hunt that cost anywhere between five and ten thousand dollars?  Maybe more.  If forking out that kind of money is not an option for you, there is still a way to hunt the same units that produce trophy after trophy every year.  Through the draw!  It may take a few years, but if you start now and stick with it, you too will eventually be hunting the best units in the Rockies, and at only a fraction of the cost of buying landowner or governor tags.</p>
				<p>With 8 states offering up to 80 hunting units per species for the non-resident hunter, where do you start in choosing the best unit to apply for?</p>

				<p>Top Draw Consulting is a company dedicated to providing accurate, up to date information for archery hunting the west.  We cater to the non-resident, DIY  hunter by providing unit by unit research and analysis.  State by state, species by species, all is done from an archery-only hunting perspective.  We break down licensing deadlines, application fee structures, draw odds, success rates and hunt dates for each available unit in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. If no archery only hunts are offered for a certain species in any state, we present all available any weapons hunt information for that species.</p>

				<p>We also look at trending trophy information by tracking quantity and quality of Pope and Young record entries for Elk, Mule Deer, Pronghorn, Bighorn Sheep, Desert Sheep, Shiras Moose, Mountain Goat and Bison.  Our objective is to put the best tags in your pocket specific to your individual goals as a hunter.  We do not work with outfitters, assuring you that our unit analysis is not being driven by business behind the scenes.  It comes directly from harvest reports, P&Y records and conversations with local biologists.  This formula ensures no biased or misleading information.   For the hard-core DIY bow hunter, there simply isn’t a better resource. </p>

				<p>The key to your success in the field begins during the application season.  First, determine the quality units specific to your goals as a hunter.  If it’s to draw a hunt with high harvest success, apply for those units with the best drawing odds that also offer a high return on harvest.  Maybe only a giant will do and you’re willing to take on steeper draw odds.  Either way, our tables will arm you with the necessary information to apply for the hunt that is right for you.  Each application season is a highly detailed process using only up to date harvest report information, record book entries, as well as input from local biologists.  From there we sort out our chances for each permit using true drawing odds rather than simple drawing odds.  This is a very important step as there is a big difference between your true odds, and simple odds.  Simple odds don’t tell the whole story.  They just tell you how many people applied for a hunt.  They don’t account for your bonus point total or the point totals of everyone else applying in the same unit.  For example, in states like Montana and Nevada, determining true odds means squaring EVERY applicant’s point totals in each unit before dividing them by your point total(also squared).  It is a time consuming process but it is the only accurate way to know which units give you the best chance to draw the hunt you’re after. </p>

				<p>Bottom line, we love what we do and enjoy helping avid archery hunters by passing that information along.  We don't want to be the biggest. Just the best.  So much so, that we are considering putting a cap on the number of clients we have.  Our take is this, the more folks that are getting 'the information', the less valuable that information becomes.   In other words, a hidden top unit isn't so hidden anymore when 40 thousand people lay eyes on it.  STOP applying for all the permits that everyone else is applying for and START drawing hunts that are just as good!  Begin investing in your hunting future today!</p>
